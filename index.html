    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end developers are responsible for a websiteâ€™s user-facing code and the architecture of its immersive user experiences. In order to execute those objectives, front-end devs must be adept at three main languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. The back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. 
       A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.
